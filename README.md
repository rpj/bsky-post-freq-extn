# Usage

This extension is not (yet) distributed on the Chrome Web Store so you'll need to load it directly.

Either method below will produce a folder that contains the extension:
load it using the ["Load an unpacked extension" method](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).

## Download

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/rpj/bsky-post-freq-extn/releases/latest) page and download the attached `BlueskyPostFrequencies_<version>.zip` in "Assets". 

Unzip it & the resulting folder is the extension.

## Build

From the project directory:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This will produce a `dist/` folder, which is the extension.
